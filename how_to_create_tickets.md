# How to Create Comprehensive Task Tickets

This guide provides a principle-based approach to creating thorough, well-researched task tickets. The goal is to deeply understand problems, explore solution spaces, and create tickets that enable excellent implementation outcomes.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Deep Problem Understanding**

- Investigate the root cause, not just symptoms
- Understand the full context and ecosystem impact
- Research similar problems and existing solutions
- Question assumptions and explore alternative framings

### 2. **Solution Space Exploration**

- Consider multiple approaches before settling on one
- Evaluate trade-offs systematically
- Think about future implications and extensibility
- Don't limit creativity with premature constraints

### 3. **User-Centric Value Focus**

- Start with user needs and pain points
- Validate assumptions about user behavior
- Consider diverse user scenarios and edge cases
- Measure success in terms of user outcomes

### 4. **System-Wide Thinking**

- Consider ripple effects across the entire system
- Think about integration points and dependencies
- Evaluate performance, security, and scalability implications
- Plan for observability and monitoring

## Comprehensive Ticket Creation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research

#### 1.1 Problem Investigation

**Deep Dive Questions:**

- What is the fundamental problem we're solving?
- Who experiences this problem and in what contexts?
- What are the current workarounds or pain points?
- How does this fit into the broader user journey?
- What similar problems exist in the industry?
- What solutions have others tried?

**Research Activities:**

- User interviews or feedback analysis
- Competitive analysis and benchmarking
- Technical research on existing solutions
- Architecture and codebase exploration
- Performance and usage data analysis

#### 1.2 Context Mapping

- Identify all stakeholders (users, developers, system components)
- Map current state vs. desired future state
- Document assumptions and unknowns
- Identify constraints and opportunities
- Consider timing and resource implications

### Phase 2: Solution Design

#### 2.1 Solution Space Exploration

**Approach Generation:**

- Brainstorm multiple solution approaches
- Consider incremental vs. revolutionary changes
- Evaluate build vs. buy vs. integrate options
- Think about different architectural patterns
- Consider various user experience approaches

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- User value and experience quality
- Technical feasibility and complexity
- Resource requirements and timeline
- Maintenance and operational burden
- Future flexibility and extensibility
- Risk assessment and mitigation

#### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- Design system interactions and data flow
- Consider scalability and performance implications
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Design for testability and maintainability
- Consider security and privacy implications
- Plan observability and monitoring strategy

### Phase 3: Specification & Planning

#### 3.1 Requirements Definition

**Functional Requirements:**

- Core functionality and user interactions
- Data requirements and constraints
- Integration requirements
- Business logic and rules

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Performance and scalability targets
- Security and privacy requirements
- Accessibility and inclusivity standards
- Compatibility and device support
- Reliability and availability expectations

#### 3.2 Success Metrics

- Define measurable success criteria
- Identify key performance indicators
- Plan for data collection and analysis
- Consider both quantitative and qualitative measures
- Set up feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Phase 4: Implementation Strategy

#### 4.1 Approach Selection

- Document the chosen approach and rationale
- Explain why other approaches were not selected
- Identify potential pivots or adaptations
- Plan for iterative development and learning

#### 4.2 Risk Management

- Identify technical and business risks
- Plan mitigation strategies
- Consider fallback options
- Plan for monitoring and early detection

## Ticket Structure (Adaptive Framework)

Use this as a flexible framework, adapting sections based on the specific context and complexity of your task:

```markdown
# [Descriptive Title That Captures the Core Value]

## Best Practices for Excellence

### Research-Driven Development

- Invest time in understanding before building
- Challenge assumptions with data and research
- Learn from existing solutions and patterns
- Consider multiple perspectives and use cases

### Systematic Thinking

- Think in systems, not just features
- Consider second and third-order effects
- Plan for failure modes and edge cases
- Design for change and evolution

### User-Centric Focus

- Start with user needs, not technical capabilities
- Validate assumptions about user behavior
- Consider diverse user scenarios and contexts
- Measure success in user outcomes

### Technical Excellence

- Design for maintainability and extensibility
- Consider performance from the beginning
- Plan for observability and debugging
- Think about security and privacy implications

### Collaborative Approach

- Involve relevant stakeholders in the process
- Seek diverse perspectives and expertise
- Document decisions and reasoning clearly
- Create shared understanding across the team

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Rushed Analysis

- Jumping to solutions without understanding problems
- Assuming you know what users want
- Copying solutions without understanding context
- Ignoring edge cases and failure modes

### Over-Specification

- Being too prescriptive about implementation details
- Limiting creative problem-solving approaches
- Assuming one-size-fits-all solutions
- Ignoring context-specific considerations

### Narrow Thinking

- Focusing only on happy path scenarios
- Ignoring system-wide implications
- Thinking only about immediate needs
- Considering only technical aspects

## Adaptation Guidelines

This framework should be adapted based on:

**Task Complexity:**

- Simple tasks may need fewer sections
- Complex features may need deeper analysis
- Research tickets may focus more on investigation
- Bug fixes may emphasize root cause analysis

**Project Context:**

- Startup vs. enterprise considerations
- Greenfield vs. legacy system implications
- Team size and expertise considerations
- Timeline and resource constraints

**Domain Specificity:**

- User-facing features vs. internal tools
- Performance-critical vs. feature-rich requirements
- Security-sensitive vs. convenience-focused features
- Real-time vs. batch processing considerations

Remember: The goal is deep understanding and thoughtful solution design, not rigid adherence to templates. Adapt this framework to serve your specific context and needs.
